## Key points
- Using [[MMXM]] to confirm BIAS and Orderflow
- Draw on liquidity on original consolidation

### Consolidation
- Common Equal lows

### Things important in MMXM - BUYSIDE CURVE
- Always starts with a original consolidation
- We can either trade judas or trade distribution after. The same goes for [[MMXM]]
- We want to see accumulations after original consolidation. And it makes retail think that there is resistance so there will be buystops above and sellstops below.
- If the price returs to original consolidation it's called safe risk buy ([[LRB]])
- If we see a opposing liquidity run to the orderflow it's just a manipulation, grab of orders.
- Sometimes on the LTF it can so there is original consolidation and one reaccumulation stage and then it will push up straight to the POI. But on the HTF it should at least have 2 reaccumulations.
- If we are in the second accumulation and we are missing 20-30pips we shouldn't expect it to go for the sellside rather it should stay inside the range.

### When should we trade MMXM
- We can use a MMXM in a weekly profile. We can use a HTF PD-array and if we also use economic calender/ high impact news. 
- We want to trade with the orderflow in the 3 first days of the week because thursday has a tendencie to a market reversal profile 
- The best way to entry is not on the top of the MMXM, but rather on the first distrubution phase of the sell curve. Because we have more confirmation and we are trading with the orderflow with a [[BOS]]
- Distributions often happen in the [[PD-array]]'s from the buyside of the curve
