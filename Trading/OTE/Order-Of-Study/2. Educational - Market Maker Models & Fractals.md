## Key points
- Using [[MMXM]] to confirm BIAS and Orderflow
- Draw on liquidity on original consolidation

### Consolidation
- Common Equal lows

### Things important in MMXM - BUYSIDE CURVE
- Always starts with a original consolidation
- We can either trade judas or trade distribution after. The same goes for [[MMXM]]
- We want to see accumulations after original consolidation. And it makes retail think that there is resistance so there will be buystops above and sellstops below.
- If the price returs to original consolidation it's called safe risk buy ([[LRB]])
- If we see a opposing liquidity run to the orderflow it's just a manipulation, grab of orders.
- Sometimes on the LTF it can so there is original consolidation and one reaccumulation stage and then it will push up straight to the POI. But on the HTF it should at least have 2 reaccumulations.
- If we are in the second accumulation and we are missing 20-30pips we shouldn't expect it to go for the sellside rather it should stay inside the[[Interbank dealing range | range]].

### When should we trade MMXM
- We can use a [[MMXM]] in a weekly profile. We can use a [[HTF]] [[PD-array]] and if we also use economic calender/ high impact news. 
- We want to trade with the orderflow in the 3 first days of the week because thursday has a tendencie to a market reversal profile 
- The best way to entry is not on the top of the [[MMXM]], but rather on the first [[Distrubution]] phase of the sell curve. Because we have more confirmation and we are trading with the orderflow with a [[BOS]]
- [[Distrubution| Distribution]] often happens in the [[PD-array]]'s from the buyside of the curve
- When we are reaching [[original consolidation]] we want to look after that 10/20/30 pips sweep. Because we want to sweep all the stoplosses below [[original consolidation]]
- All of this can be reverse to the other side/ upside down.

## Price likes to go and collect [[Fair Value Gap]]'s when before forming that [[LTH]] on [[MMXM]]

## Key points
- If we go into a FVG while not in a significant killzone like NY or London we want to see the price the price going back into it in a better killzone and continue from there.
- We can have more accumulation/distrubution phases on both curves
- We want to see it hit that HTF POI 
- We want to use the[[Interbank dealing range | range]] for a good entry
- We want to try to enter after that first accumulation to see how the price is moving 
- We can use [[PD-array]]'s to see on which side we are on.
- If bearish is respected then we that means we are going downwards, if bullish upwards
- If we don't have any equal highs on major liqudity points we can predict the price to go lower after a [[BOS]]
- The price dosen't need to finish the model it can have one more distribution.


# Timeframe aligment
Weekly > Daily/4H FVG
Daily     > 4H/1H FVG
4H        > 60m/15m FVG
1H        > 15m/5m FVG

## [[Fractals]]
- Everything that happens on the monthly,weekly and daily happens also on the 1h, 15m, 5m
- We can always find more [[MMXM]]'s on lower timeframe. But the lower the timeframe the more liquidity grabs.
