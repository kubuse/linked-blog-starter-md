#### Here we have an example of Highs and Lows

### LTH/LTL

- When we have a [[LTL]] or [[LTH]] we anticipate it to not be taken out

With all of this we can anticipate the BIas where the price is going to target. 

After a LTH and the start of bearish orderflow we can anticipate that we are going to target all the STL or even LTL.

### Important to note

- When we have a LTL we want to see STL on the both sides of it.


## Liqudity

### **Key points**
- We want to target liqudity on old lows and old highs thats the simplest liqudity
- Old lows and Highs are basially Buy or Sell stops
- We want to look after equal lows or highs because retail will see that as support/resistance
- [[Fair Value Gap]] a internal range liqudity target.
- If we want to know where the price is going we need to know what liqudity was taken


# Premium & Discount           

       ![](https://i.imgur.com/l1jRFLM.png)

### Why is this important
- We want to buy something at a lower price and sell something when has higher price. 
- A range is a way to determine that buying and selling point in trading 
   
## Key points
- We want to make a[[Interbank dealing range | range]] when Buyside and Sellside is taken we want to draw[[Interbank dealing range | range]] to that new high and low
- We can use [[AMD]] to determine where we are heding 
- When we want to place a long we need to be sure to place it on a PD-array in discount [[Interbank dealing range | range]] and the opposite when we want to sell.
- In the photo above we can see a[[Interbank dealing range | range]] after a [[LTH]] when the price made a [[BOS]] and went back into a PD-array in premium in the smaller[[Interbank dealing range | range]]. After that it continued lower.
- When the price is in discount we know that it can't continue down lower. First it  need to go into internal[[Interbank dealing range | range]] liquidity to continue down lower.

# Fair Value Gap

## Key points 
- A [[Fair Value Gap]] need to have 3 candles
- A [[Fair Value Gap]] is formed between wicks in 3 candles of the same color
- There are another types of [[Fair Value Gap]]'s

# Orderblock

## Key points
- A [[Orderblock]] is a candle that is 2 times smaller than the next candles in opposite direction.
- A [[Orderblock]] is supposed to support the price in another way
- A wick can be used in marking of [[Orderblock]]
- It's a good place to take a trade of.
- Equalibrium in a [[Orderblock]] is a very important place it shows us if the [[Orderblock]] will be taken out.
- More candles can form a[[Orderblock]] 
- If a [[Orderblock]] takes out one that took liqudity before. Like in the example of Bearish Orderblock
- A bullish orderblock should be used in a discount[[Interbank dealing range | range]]. A bearish should be used in a premium[[Interbank dealing range | range]].

# Breaker Block

## Key points 
- A [[Breaker Blocks]] is a [[Orderblock]] that was broken through and after the [[Orderblock]] a high or low was taken.
- Big institutions want to mitigate their orders on the [[Breaker Blocks]]
- If a OB is broken through but a high or low isn't taken that means we have a mitigation block ([[MB]])
