## What is redelivery
- Once a bullish FVG has been created, for example a BiSi(buyisde imbalance, sellside inefficiency), only buyside has been provided. Price needs to redelivered to provided sellside. Once the occurs, we have redelivered price.
## What is rebalancing
- Once that bullish FVG has been redelivered, it should act as support and price should move up. If we trawde through that FVG, price will use this FVG as a reference point to come to and use it as a resistanse. Once price trades back into taht OLD FVG, price has been rebalance and can continue dwn with higher probability of not returning higher.

## Keynotes
- Every time a FVG has been created we want to redeliver or rebalance it.
- If we see accumulation in or above a FVG we can be wary that this is not the gap where it's gonna retrace or go back.

- We can see that the price went through that bullish FVG and returned to it in the next candle rebalancing it.

## Rebalancing
- A FVG at that is broken and still supports the price
## Redelivery
- When a FVG is simply filled 


## Key levels
- When the price is rebalanced we can anticipate it going lower, especially when we have a bullish FVG 
- We want a significant take of a FVG

## Keylevel
+ Here we can see a BOS and we want to see the price targeting after the previous day low.
+ We want to sell from a premium [[Interbank dealing range|range]] and therfore we have a good entry on that rebalancing and redelivery of price
+ On GJ we can use 20-30 pip stoploss because it is capable of giving 100 pips

## Keylevel

- FVG's are a good way to find a entry. 
- When a FVG is supporting price after longer time it is a good place for a entry
