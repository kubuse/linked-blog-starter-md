## What is redelivery
- Once a bullish [[Fair Value Gap|FVG]] has been created, for example a [[Fair Value Gap#^b640b9|BiSi]](buyisde imbalance, sellside inefficiency), only buyside has been provided. Price needs to redelivered to provided sellside. Once the occurs, we have redelivered price.
## What is rebalancing
- Once that bullish [[Fair Value Gap|FVG]] has been redelivered, it should act as support and price should move up. If we trade through that [[Fair Value Gap|FVG]], price will use this [[Fair Value Gap|FVG]] as a reference point to come to and use it as a resistanse. Once price trades back into taht OLD FVG, price has been rebalance and can continue down with higher probability of not returning higher.
