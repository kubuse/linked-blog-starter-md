## What is redelivery
- Once a bullish FVG has been created, for example a BiSi(buyisde imbalance, sellside inefficiency), only buyside has been provided. Price needs to redelivered to provided sellside. Once the occurs, we have redelivered price.
## What is rebalancing
- Once that bullish FVG has been redelivered, it should act as support and price should move up. If we trawde through that FVG, price will use this FVG as a reference point to come to and use it as a resistanse. Once price trades back into taht OLD FVG, price has been rebalance and can continue dwn with higher probability of not returning higher.

## Keynotes
- Every time a FVG has been created we want to redeliver or rebalance it.
- If we see accumulation in or above a FVG we can be wary that this is not the gap where it's gonna retrace or go back.

- We can see that the price went through that bullish FVG and returned to it in the next candle rebalancing it.
