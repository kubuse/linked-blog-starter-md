# Key points

- Here we should look for sells because we have a BPR that should support the price lower.
- It is also in a OTE level
- Also a high probability OB above
- Asia has above 40 pips that means the london shouldn't be traded, unless a perfect setup.
- Asia should have above 20 pips

# Flout 
- Flout refers to the central bank dealers range and the Asian range combined. It is the highest high and the lowest low in the form of the wick and the bodies of the candles during that time window. To calculate the standard deviation for flout, find the highest high and lowest low, divide that range in half, and project it up. This standard deviation is used to look for confluence with central bank dealers range and Asian range for ideal entries in trading
- He used it on 10:00 in the video

# Key points 
- We want to sell above daily open price (DOP) and buy below 
- If a pair has very bullish intention it can disrespect a premium range and continue lower, but it's worth to wait for that premium any way
- The best FVG's are inside of premium or discount not on the midway point. They are okay if the middel of them is inside the right range.
- The day before NFP there will be shitty price action


# The part about Internal & External

# Key points

- Is good to know for good stoplosses. 
- Many of the External liqudity is protected
- Use range
-  Here OTE uses a bit different concpet for ERL / IRL
- Swings can be IRL
- When a range is taken out it means that we took the ERL
- It depends from what timeframe we are on. On some timeframes the Swing will be a ERL and on higher it could be a IRL. TIme is fractal

-  If we see bullish order flow every external liquidity should be a protected low.

- Here the price shouldn't take the Exteranl range high because it's against orderflow. We had a BOS and We have already taken the ERL on highs before now it's time for the lows.
- We want to pair our entries with buy stops and sell stops.
- A propulsion block that supports price?
- The lower the timeframe the weaker the overalpping FVG become.
- A aliging FVG should only support the price ones.
- Dont use a FVG that has been traded through
- Remember to use partials and think about how much pips a pair can move during a day.
