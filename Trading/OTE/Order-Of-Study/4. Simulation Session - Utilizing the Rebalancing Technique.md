# Key levels
- We can see this FVG, we want to go down to rebalance it because the price on 5m went to fast through it. 
- If a [[Orderblock|OB]] causes BOS it will become a high probability orderblock
- We want to stick with a HTF and trade in a killzone.
- When we are out of kilzzone sometimes the fvg's aren't respected but when in a killzone they become respected

# Keylevel
- Here we can see that the price formed a LTL inside the FVG and also the wick hit that FVG so the price won't go back after that next low has formed 
- If going for a late entry we should always remember to have a bigger stoploss.
- We can use power of three on a hourly chart
- After NY open in 2 hours the price has only consolidated that is a bad sign.
- A [[Balanced Price Range|BPR]] is 2 fair value gaps passing through each other 
- Asia pairs move more in asia session
-
