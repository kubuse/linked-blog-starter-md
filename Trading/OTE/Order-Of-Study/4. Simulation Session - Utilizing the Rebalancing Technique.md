# Key levels
- We can see this [[Fair Value Gap|FVG]], we want to go down to rebalance it because the price on 5m went to fast through it. 
- If a [[Orderblock|OB]] causes [[Break of Strucuture|BOS]] it will become a high probability [[Orderblock|orderblock]]
- We want to stick with a HTF and trade in a killzone.
- When we are out of killzone sometimes the [[Fair Value Gap|fvg]]'s aren't respected but when in a killzone they become respected

# Keylevel
- Here we can see that the price formed a [[Highs and Lows|LTL]] inside the [[Fair Value Gap|FVG]] and also the wick hit that [[Fair Value Gap|FVG]] so the price won't go back after that next low has formed 
- If going for a late entry we should always remember to have a bigger stoploss.
- We can use three candle pattern on a hourly chart
- After NY open in 2 hours the price has only consolidated that is a bad sign.
- A [[Balanced Price Range|BPR]] is 2 [[Fair Value Gap|fair value gaps]] passing through each other 
- Asia pairs move more in asia session
