When a currency has bad Bias or bad conditions to trade in we should use cross currency analysis.


We want to be in the one that is moving cleanest and has biggest moves

# High resistance and Low resistance liquidity


# High resistance liquidity run

- Every run for a low or high against orderflow is a high resistance liqudity run


# Low resistance liqudity run

- The price is trading to a place where there arent any resistance.
- Equal lows
- FVG's

- Big liquity voids as low resistance - It has to be redelivered and rebalanced at some point. So when orderflow suggest going towards that liqudity that will be our target for a low resistance liqudity run.
