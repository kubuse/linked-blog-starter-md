1. A long term high needs some significance behind it (HTF POI)
2. Break of Structure with Displacement, means smart money is trading currently.
3. Shortterm high raid
4. Second displacement is safer

## Key points
- That ITL in type 2 can form because of a FVG or OB that supports the price higher.
- Best entry on the ITH on the first displacement leg. Also could entry on the second.
- We can entry on more opertuntities. Instead of going for the first pd array we can split the percantage between more entrie like 0.33% risk for 3 different pd arrays on entry.
- If a FVG is traded through we can see the redelivery and rebalancing of it to the sellside.


# Backtesting 

- Using LTL, ITH, STH then we have good BIAS for a trade. 
- An orderblock with FVG is high probability
- If we have a big displacemnet after a ITH we should expect the price to not go further down and we can place our entry in the middel of a FVG and for example a stoploss under a OB
