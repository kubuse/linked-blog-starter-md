1. We want to start off with an original consolidation.
- Original consolidation often has equal high/lows
2. There is always an SMT with a high probability reversal, also a POI
- We want to trade the stronger pair that is stronger towards our original consolidation.
- In 70% of cases, tuesday creates the high or low of the week
- We want to trade the pair that didn't take the low.

- We also need to remember the accumulation in MMXM
