# Crude depiction of a Moving pair

- Using SMT with correlated pairs like JPYGBP / JPYEUR, NQ, SP500
- We can see that DXY should make a higher high when eur is doing a lower low.
- If we want to see the DXY going bullish, we want first see an SMT

# An Example of SMT

- The DXY took higher high, while EURUSD didn't take lower low. This means 
- It means euro wants to only go higher and when DXY took the high it wants to go more towards downside.

# An Example of High Probability SMT

- SMT is a very good tool to see if the market is about to reverse.

- We can see equal high on the Euro and DXY is failing to make lower lows, and it makes failure swings by that.
- When seeing how that pairs move, the Equal Highs shouldn't be the DOL, because they fail to take the lows on both these pairs showing tendencies in the other direction.
- PD-arrays can also be used as SMT, when a PD-array isn't hit, it can also be a sign of reversal. 
- Sometimes SMT could not work because there is too much to make the price go back
- Orderflow is important when using SMT.
