# Monthly

We want to fill in FVG below that means we have bearish orderflow

# Weekly

Here on weekly our best pd array is an old high

# Daily

![[Pasted image 20231107213247.png]]

We filled the weekly FVG and raided the low so we want to see the price moving up. We can expect it going top that high. If we disrespect the FVG we have confirmation

We rebalance the price and continue higher if it continue upwards its high probability for bullish

After the OB formed we don't want it to trade below 50% of the OB


# H4

We want to put entry above the EQ and stoploss below the OB



# Tips


After forming previous dailylow that went into PD array and made DOL the next day we can be sure that we will be aiming for that previous day high.

We want to use opposite pd arrays but in this example there aren't any. So we aim for previous highs.

Stoploss below [[Highs and Lows|ITL]] or [[Highs and Lows|ITH]]

If the next candle here is going to be bearish we want to quit the trade

We need to remember about premium/discount
