## Concept behind Order Blocks: 
• MUST take liquidity prior

• Bullish - Last down candle which swept liquidity 
• Bearish - Last up candle which swept liquidity

## Key points of orderblocks

- A OB is a candle that is 2 times smaller than the next candles in opposite direction.
- A OB is supposed to support the price in another way
- A wick can be used in marking of OB
- It's a good place to take a trade of.
- Equalibrium in aOB is a very important place it shows us if the OB will be taken out.
- More candles can form a OB
- If a OB takes out one that took liqudity before. Like in the example of Bearish Orderblock
- A bullish orderblock should be used in a discount[[Interbank dealing range | range]]. A bearish should be used in a premium[[Interbank dealing range | range]].
